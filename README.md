I aim to investigate the determinants (in-firm training, number of labors) of innovation in firms in Cambodia using Enterprise Survey(ES) data in Cambodia from the World Bank. (https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/)
By applying a simple Linear Probability Model and heteroskedasticity-robust standard error, I found that there was indeed a significant increase in probability by as much as 30% of firms innovative activities (product, process, and marketing) for firms that provide in-firm training to their employees.
